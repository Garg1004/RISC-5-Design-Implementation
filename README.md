# RISC-5-Design-Implementation
This project involves the design and implementation of a RISC-V based 16/32-bit processor using Verilog HDL on Xilinx Vivado. The processor follows the RV32I instruction set architecture, covering fundamental RISC-V instructions such as arithmetic, logical and memory operations.
