# RISC-5-Design-Implementation
This project involves the design and implementation of a RISC-V based 16/32-bit processor using Verilog HDL on Xilinx Vivado. The processor follows the RV32I instruction set architecture, covering fundamental RISC-V instructions such as arithmetic, logical and memory operations.

## Features
- Implementation of a 5-stage RISC-V pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back).  
- Supports arithmetic, logical, branch, and memory operations.  
- Modular design with separate Verilog files for each component.  
- Testbenches developed for verifying the complete processor.  
- Synthesized and verified using Xilinx Vivado toolchain.  

## Tools and Technology
- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado  

## Learning Outcomes
- Developed practical understanding of RISC-V architecture.  
- Designed and verified processor datapath and control logic.  
- Strengthened knowledge of modular digital design and HDL coding practices.
